## In silico analysis of varVAMP schemes

This repository contains the complete code and input files for the in silico analysis of varVAMP schemes.

To reproduce the figures run:

```bash
git clone github.com/jonas-fuchs/varVAMP_in_silico_analysis
cd varVAMP_in_silico_analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 in_silico_eval.py
```

This creates a new ``output`` folder with plots and data used in the publication:

**"varVAMP: automatic pan-specific primer design for tiled full genome sequencing and qPCR of highly diverse viral pathogens."**
